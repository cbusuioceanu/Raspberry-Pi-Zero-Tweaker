# Raspberry Pi Zero Tweaker
Raspberry Pi Zero Tweaker - CPU Info - Clock speed - Temperatures - Voltage - Overclocking - Change Governor &amp; more

#### Raspberry Pi Zero Tweaker is a script written exclusively on a Raspberry Pi Zero device.

#### In case of overclocking, we recommend using a Raspberry Pi cooling kit (heatsinks).

#### With this script, you can do / watch / monitor the following:

##### -> CPU temperature
##### -> CPU Voltage
##### -> Minimum CPU speed
##### -> Maximum CPU speed
##### -> Current CPU speed
##### -> Sampling rate> if the CPU governor is "ondemand"
##### -> Sampling rate min (minimum sampling rate)> if the CPU governor is "ondemand"
##### -> Upper threshold (maximum CPU load threshold for recommended frequency increase, 50%)> if the CPU governor is "ondemand"
##### -> Transition latency (CPU speed change is done in x nano seconds)
##### -> CPU governor change (governor: performance, powersave, userspace, ondemand, conservative)
##### -> Overclocking
##### -> Check script updates from the main menu or update it from Git
